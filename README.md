# Health System API

This project presents students with the challenge of designing and implementing a Health System API that addresses the complex requirements of modern healthcare management. The API serves as a foundational platform for various healthcare applications, offering essential functionalities for patient management, appointment scheduling, medical record keeping, prescription management, and billing. It is designed with a focus on REST API design and implementation using JAX-RS and JSON parsing with Jackson.

## Features

### Functionality Overview

The Health System API includes the following key functionalities:

- **Patient Management**: CRUD operations for managing patient information.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Ability to schedule and manage patient appointments.
- **Medical Record Keeping**: Storage and retrieval of patient medical records.
- **Prescription Management**: Management of prescriptions and medications.
- **Billing**: Handling billing and financial transactions related to healthcare services.

### External Interaction

To interact with the API:
1. **Clone the Project**: Clone the repository into your local environment.
2. **Import into IDE**: Import the project into an IDE that supports web services (e.g., Netbeans, Eclipse).
3. **Setup Apache Tomcat**: Ensure Apache Tomcat version 9 is installed and configured as the server.
4. **Start the Server**: Run the server to deploy the application.
5. **Send Requests**: Utilize tools like Postman to send HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with the API endpoints.

## Getting Started

To run the Health System API:
- Clone the project repository.
- Import it into your preferred IDE.
- Ensure Apache Tomcat 9 is set up and running.
- Deploy the application on the server.
- Use Postman or similar tools to test and interact with the API endpoints.
